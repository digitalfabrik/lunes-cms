*****************
Development Tools
*****************

This is a collection of scripts which facilitate the development process.
They are targeted at as much platforms and configurations as possible, but there might be edge cases in which they donâ€™t work as expected.

Installation
============

Install all project dependencies and the local python package with :github-source:`tools/install.sh`::

    ./tools/install.sh [--clean] [--pre-commit]

* ``--clean``: Remove all installed dependencies in the ``.venv/`` and ``node_modules/`` directories as well as compiled
  static files in ``lunes_cms/static/dist/``.
* ``--pre-commit``: Install all :ref:`pre-commit-hooks`

Development Server
==================

Run the inbuilt local webserver with :github-source:`tools/run.sh`::

    ./tools/run.sh [--fast]

**Options:**

* ``--fast``: Skip migrations and translation on startup and just start Django

Translations
============

Perform ``makemessages`` and ``compilemessages`` in one step with :github-source:`tools/translate.sh`::

    ./tools/translate.sh

Resolve merge/rebase conflicts with :github-source:`tools/resolve_translation_conflicts.sh`::

    ./tools/resolve_translation_conflicts.sh

Check whether your translations is up-to-date with :github-source:`tools/check_translations.sh`::

    ./tools/check_translations.sh

Test Data
=========

Import test data into the database :github-source:`tools/load_test_data.sh`::

    ./tools/load_test_data.sh

Documentation
=============

Build this documentation with :github-source:`tools/build_documentation.sh`::

    ./tools/build_documentation.sh [--clean]

**Options:**

* ``--clean``: Remove all temporary documentation files in the ``docs/src/ref/`` directory
  as well as the compiled html output in ``docs/dist``. Existing outdated documentation files can cause the
  generation script to fail if e.g. source files were added or deleted.
