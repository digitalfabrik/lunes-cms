**********************
Documentation (Sphinx)
**********************

To generate this documentation, we use the Python documentation generator Sphinx (see :doc:`sphinx:usage/index`).

The generation process is divided into two stages:

1. :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-apidoc` is a tool which scans the whole source code of our application in the ``lunes_cms``
   directory and generates ``.rst`` files out of the Python docstrings. These files are then placed in the
   ``docs/src/ref`` directory.
2. :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-build` generates the html documentation out of the ``.rst`` files located in the sphinx directory.
   It merges the static ``.rst`` files directly in the ``docs/src`` directory together with the files generated in step 1
   in ``docs/src/ref``.

Developer Tools
===============

Generate this documentation with :github-source:`tools/generate_documentation.sh`::

    ./tools/generate_documentation.sh [--clean]

Apart from the two steps above, this tool also performs the additional tasks:

* Modify the autogenerated ``.rst`` files to improve the readability by removing module paths in headings.

If the ``--clean`` parameter is provided, the script will clean all temporary documentation files in the ``docs/src/ref/``
directory as well as the compiled html output in ``docs/dist``. Existing outdated documentation
files can cause the generation script to fail if e.g. source files were added or deleted.
