We use :doc:`pytest <pytest:index>` to validate that the functionality of the cms works as expected.

In addition, we use the following plugins:

* :doc:`pytest-cov <pytest-cov:index>`: This plugin produces coverage reports.
* :doc:`pytest-django <pytest-django:index>`: Provide a few helpers for Django
* :doc:`pytest-xdist:index`: Enable distributing tests across multiple CPUs to speed up test execution

For more information, see :doc:`topics/testing/index` and :doc:`topics/testing/overview`.
